# Outline:

- A clean, dark, minimal to-do list app that allows users to categorize tasks by colour-coded categories and a priority level. The app removes any distractions and only shows the users what is truly important. The app is built using Flutter and data is persisted using SQL (via sqflite).

# Purpose:

- Making apps had always been a subject of intrigue for me; the challenge of crafting a beautiful user interface that is both inviting as well as captivating, alongside the challenge of devising a user experience devoid of errors where all user actions that could cause potential bugs are accounted for, plus ultimately linking this design to a well-conjured back-end system which ensures that the app can flow smoothly. I wanted in.
- I had encountered Flutter while scouring videos on YouTube where people where full of praises for its design, host of plugins and high speed native support across platforms using a single codebase and it seemed like a wonderful package. Learning dart was not too tough owing to some experience with Java and a background in OOP programming with Python. Ultimately, I wanted (and want to) build a simple password manager to solve some key needs in my life but to get there, I had to first learn the basics of Flutter, and build apps that can persist data.
- Enter this app, a perfect stepping stone in that it would force me to learn how to use the sqflite plugin to store data, challenge me to create an engaging, clean UI as well as solving a personal need in wanting a distraction-free to-do list app with certain capabilities.
- In no way is this a complete project, I hope to be able to add some push-notification feature in the coming future as well as refactor my spaghetti code, which has come about owing to lack of experience with Flutter and Dart, and once I get enough knowledge on ideas like state management and figure out how to leverage the OOP mechanisms of dart, I will be able to prune this temporarily messy code.
- A resource that I used immensely in order to learn how to work with the sqflite plugin was this [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BwjNEKD8g8&ab_channel=Smartherd) by Smartherd.
