# Outline:

- A clean, dark, minimal to-do list app that allows users to categorize tasks by colour-coded categories and a priority level. The app removes any distractions and only shows the users what is truly important. The app is built using Flutter and data is persisted using SQL (via sqflite).

- A detailed description of the different features of the application - how they were implemented - as well as a full layout of the app and its routing can be found in the description section down below.

# Purpose:

- Making apps had always been a subject of intrigue for me; the challenge of crafting a beautiful user interface that is both inviting as well as captivating, alongside the challenge of devising a user experience devoid of errors where all user actions that could cause potential bugs are accounted for, plus ultimately linking this design to a well-conjured back-end system which ensures that the app can flow smoothly. I wanted in.
- I had encountered Flutter while scouring videos on YouTube where people where full of praises for its design, host of plugins and high speed native support across platforms using a single codebase and it seemed like a wonderful package. Learning dart was not too tough owing to some experience with Java and a background in OOP programming with Python. Ultimately, I wanted (and want to) build a simple password manager to solve some key needs in my life but to get there, I had to first learn the basics of Flutter, and build apps that can persist data.
